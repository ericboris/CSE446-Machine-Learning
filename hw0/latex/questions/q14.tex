% 14.a.
\subsection{}

Find the minimum and maximum rank of $\sum_{i=1}^n v_i v_i^T$. Since $v_i$ is non-zero for all $1 \leq i \leq n$ the minimum rank of $\sum_{i=1}^n v_i v_i^T$ is $1$. The maximum rank is dependent on the smallest dimesion after summation, or $min\{n, d\}$.

% 14.b.
\subsection{}

Find the minimum and maximum rank of $V$. The answer to this is clearly the same as the above and for the same reasons. Thus, $rank_{min}(V) = 1$. and $rank_{max}(V) = min\{n, d\}$.

% 14.c.
\subsection{}

Find the minimum and maximum rank of $\sum_{i=1}^n (Av_i)(Av_i)^T$. The minimum rank is 0 since A could be a zero matrix. The maximum rank is $min\{n, d\}$. 

% 14.d.
\subsection{}

Find the minimum and maximum rank of $AV$. The answer to this is the same as above. Thus, $rank_{min}(AV) = 0$ and $rank_{max}(AV) = min\{n, d\}$. And if V is rank d? Then the minimum rank remains the same, $rank_{min}(AV) = 0$, and since $d \leq n$, $rank_{max}(AV) = d$.
