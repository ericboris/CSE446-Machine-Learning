1. The answers to these questions should be answerable without referring
to external materials. \textbf{Please input brief explanation for T/F questions as well}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item\points{2} In your own words, describe what bias and variance are. What is the bias-variance tradeoff?
	\input{body/a1_a.tex}	
    \item \points{2} What happens to bias and variance when model complexity increases/decreases? 
	\input{body/a1_b.tex}
    \item \points{1} True or False: The bias of a model increases as the amount of available training data increases.
	\input{body/a1_c.tex}
    \item \points{1} True or False: The variance of a model decreases as the amount of available training data increases.
	\input{body/a1_d.tex}
    \item \points{1} True or False: A learning algorithm will always generalize better if we use fewer features to represent our data.
	\input{body/a1_e.tex}
    \item \points{2} To obtain superior performance on new unseen data, should we use the training set or the test set to tune our hyperparameters?
	\input{body/a1_f.tex}
    \item \points{1} True or False: The training error of a function on the training set provides an overestimate of the true error of that function.
	\input{body/a1_g.tex}
    \item \points{1} True or False: Using L2 regularization when training a linear regression model encourages it to use less input features when making a prediction.
