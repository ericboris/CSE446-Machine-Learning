4. \points{10} In World War 2, the Allies attempted to estimate the
total number of tanks the Germans had manufactured by looking at the
serial numbers of the German tanks they had destroyed. The idea was
that if there were $n$ total tanks with serial numbers $\{1,\dots,n\}$
then it is reasonable to expect the observed serial numbers of the
destroyed tanks constituted a uniform random sample (without
replacement) from this set. The exact maximum likelihood estimator for
this so-called \emph{German tank problem} is non-trivial and quite
challenging to work out (try it!). For our homework, we will consider
a much easier problem with a similar flavor.

Let $x_1,\dots,x_n$ be independent, uniformly distributed on the continuous domain $[0,\theta]$ for some $\theta$. What is the Maximum likelihood estimate for $\theta$?\\
