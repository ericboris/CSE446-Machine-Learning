The L1 norm penalty results in a more sparse features than the L2 norm because the {\bf L1 ball is diamond shaped with vertices on the axes} while the {\bf L2 norm is spherical}. This means that an intersection between the function's contour lines with the L1 ball are more likely to occur on an axis, resulting in zeros for the other axes, than with the L2 norm.
