\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf I is convex}.
    \item {\bf II is not convex} because points b and c are in the set but the line segment $\overline{\textrm{bc}}$ is not.
    \item {\bf III is not convex} because points a and d are in the set but the line segment $\overline{\textrm{ad}}$ is not.
\end{itemize}
